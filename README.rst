=======
DataUtils
=======

A library for things I find myself constantly reimplementing

Installation
============
installing (you may need sudo)::

    $ python setup.py install

Documentation
=============
There is none, but if there was, this is how it would work.
You'll need `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ to build documentation.
Sphinx is available from PyPI or if you have easy install::
	
    $ easy_intall -U Sphinx

Once you've obtained Sphinx build html documentation::

	$ cd /path/to/DataUtils/doc/
	$ make html

pdf documentation is not currently working.
